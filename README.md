# Warframe Market Stats
Simple React web interface to display statistics for warframe item prices. Pay a visit at [https://edwin-tandiono.github.io/warframe-market-stats](https://edwin-tandiono.github.io/warframe-market-stats) to try it!

## Description
Warframe Market is a great app that allows users to place their orders for in-game items. Not only that, users also use this app to determine item prices based on its statistics. However, accessing the statistics page through the app requires a few clicks and loads away. This interface is made to include all the information I need to determine item prices in one page.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the application using `npm start`

## Usage
Select an item to view its stats from the dropdown available on the page. Upon selection, the statistics of the item will appear--which includes:
* Latest daily average price  
* Lowest offer from online seller
* Highest offer from online buyer
* 90 days line chart of related transactions

I find all the prices listed enough to determine a price of my own, and the chart is handy to decide whether to sell/buy or wait for future increase/decrease in price.
